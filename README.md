## About me
My name is Ewelina Stańczak. I am a Chemical Technologist with more than 6 years of experience in a manufacturing and trading company. I am open to new challenges, so I started self-study of software testing, which brings me a lot of satisfaction. I would like to develop further in this field. I am gaining my first experience as a software tester while testing web and mobile applications on the uTest platform. On GitHub I will upload the projects I make while learning testing.

## Tools
*Jira - testing management tool
*qTest - test case management tool
*Windows - operating system
*Xampp - integrated package consisting mainly of an Apache server, MySQL database and interpreters for scripts written in PHP and Perl

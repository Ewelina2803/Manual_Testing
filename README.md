## About me
My name is Ewelina Sta≈Ñczak. I am a Chemical Technologist with more than 6 years of experience in a manufacturing and trading company. I am open to new challenges, so I started self-study of software testing, which brings me a lot of satisfaction. I would like to develop further in this field.

## About me
I am a Chemical Technologist with more than 6 years of experience in a manufacturing and trading company. I am open to new challenges, so I started self-study of software testing, which brings me a lot of satisfaction. I would like to develop further in this field. I am gaining my first experience as a software tester while testing web and mobile applications on the uTest platform. On GitHub I will upload the projects I make while learning testing.
